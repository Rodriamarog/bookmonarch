# Flask Modernization - Testing Checklist

Use this checklist to verify all functionality is working correctly.

## Pre-Testing Setup

- [ ] Python 3.11+ installed
- [ ] Node.js 18+ installed  
- [ ] Virtual environment created and activated
- [ ] Backend dependencies installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)

- [ ] Supabase project configured
- [ ] Gemini API key configured

## Backend Testing

### Configuration and Setup
- [ ] `python deployment.py validate` passes

- [ ] Flask server starts without errors (`python app.py`)
- [ ] Health check endpoint responds: `curl http://localhost:5000/api/health`
- [ ] Root endpoint responds: `curl http://localhost:5000/`

### API Endpoints
- [ ] Health check returns status "healthy"

- [ ] Book status shows as "Completed"
- [ ] Individual download buttons work from book list
- [ ] Book deletion works correctly
- [ ] Deleted books are removed from list
- [ ] Backend logs confirm file cleanup

## Error Handling

### Validation Errors
- [ ] Empty title shows validation error
- [ ] Title too long (>200 chars) shows error
- [ ] Empty author shows validation error
- [ ] Author too long (>100 chars) shows error
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly

### Authentication Errors
- [ ] Unauthenticated users are redirected to login
- [ ] Invalid tokens return 401 errors
- [ ] Token expiration is handled gracefully

### Rate Limiting
- [ ] Rate limits are enforced (5 books per hour)
- [ ] Rate limit errors show retry-after information
- [ ] Rate limit headers are present in responses

### Network Errors
- [ ] Backend offline shows appropriate error
- [ ] Network timeouts are handled gracefully
- [ ] Retry logic works for transient failures

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing
- [ ] Multiple concurrent generations work
- [ ] System remains responsive under load
- [ ] No race conditions or data corruption
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable

### Content Testing
- [ ] Long titles (near 200 chars) work
- [ ] Complex topics generate successfully
- [ ] Large generated content is handled properly
- [ ] Generation completes within reasonable time

## Security Testing

### CORS Configuration
- [ ] CORS allows frontend origin (`http://localhost:3000`)
- [ ] CORS blocks unauthorized origins
- [ ] Preflight requests work correctly

### Authentication
- [ ] JWT tokens are validated properly
- [ ] Invalid tokens are rejected
- [ ] Users can only access their own books
- [ ] Service role key is used for storage operations

### Input Sanitization
- [ ] HTML in inputs is escaped
- [ ] Special characters are handled safely
- [ ] SQL injection attempts are blocked
- [ ] File path traversal is prevented

## Integration Testing

### Supabase Integration
- [ ] Database operations work correctly
- [ ] File storage operations work correctly
- [ ] Authentication integration works
- [ ] RLS policies are enforced

### Gemini API Integration
- [ ] API calls succeed
- [ ] Rate limiting is handled
- [ ] Content generation works
- [ ] Error responses are handled

## Production Readiness

### Configuration
- [ ] Production environment variables are set
- [ ] Debug mode is disabled for production
- [ ] Logging is configured appropriately
- [ ] Security headers are present

### Deployment
- [ ] Gunicorn configuration works
- [ ] Docker build succeeds
- [ ] Health checks work in containers
- [ ] Environment validation passes

## Final Verification

### Complete User Journey
- [ ] User can sign up/login
- [ ] User can generate a book end-to-end
- [ ] User can download all file formats
- [ ] User can manage their books
- [ ] User can delete books
- [ ] System handles errors gracefully

### System Health
- [ ] No memory leaks during extended use
